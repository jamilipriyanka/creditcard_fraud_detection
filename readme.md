# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

A machine learning system that detects fraudulent credit card transactions using a European cardholder dataset. The project addresses the challenge of extreme class imbalance (0.172% fraud cases) through various sampling techniques and compares five machine learning algorithms to find the optimal approach for fraud detection.

## Problem Statement

The aim of this project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. This is crucial from both the bank's and customer's perspectives. Banks cannot afford to lose their customers' money to fraudsters, as every fraud is a loss to the bank.

The dataset contains transactions made over a period of two days in September 2013 by European credit cardholders. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for only 0.172% of all transactions. We need to address this data imbalance while building the model and identify the best model by trying various algorithms.

## âœ¨ Key Features

* **Upload Dataset**: Users can upload a CSV file containing credit card transaction data.
* **Make Predictions**: Enter transaction details to check for fraud risk.
* **Dashboard**: Visualize transaction patterns, train machine learning models, and compare model performance.
* **Advanced Analytics**: Analyze behavioral patterns, detect anomalies, and assess risk scores.
* **Technologies**:
  * **Streamlit**: Interactive web application for user-friendly interface.
  * **Pandas & NumPy**: Robust data processing and numerical operations.
  * **Matplotlib, Seaborn & Plotly**: Dynamic and interactive data visualizations.
  * **Scikit-learn**: Powerful machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
  * **XGBoost**: Advanced gradient boosting for superior model performance.

## Algorithms Used

We have utilized a total of **5 algorithms** in our project:

1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbours
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest
5. XgBoost

## Sampling Techniques

We employed **six techniques** for undersampling or oversampling:

1. Random Oversampling
2. SMOTE Oversampling
3. Random Undersampling
4. Tomek Links Undersampling
5. Cluster Centroids Undersampling
6. SMOTE + Tomek Links

## Results

- We compared each of the 5 algorithms across all 7 scenarios (Normal data + Six undersampled or oversampled data) by evaluating their accuracy through the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the ROC Curve.
- **XgBoost** emerged as the best algorithm in many simulations.
- The performance of classifiers can be significantly improved when sampling methods are used to rebalance the two classes.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the web application
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and metrics
- **XGBoost**: For advanced boosting algorithms
- **imbalanced-learn**: For handling imbalanced datasets
